 # Finding Square Roots

**Problem Link:** https://www.codechef.com/problems/FLOORSQRT  

In olden days, finding square roots seemed to be difficult, but nowadays it can be easily done using in-built functions available across many programming languages.

Assume that you want to try finding the square root of a given integer using in-built functions.

---

## Input

- The first line contains an integer **T**, the number of test cases.
- The next **T** lines each contain an integer **N**, whose square root needs to be computed.

---

## Output

- For each test case, output the **square root of N**, rounded **down to the nearest integer**, on a new line.

---

## Constraints

- `1 ≤ T ≤ 20`
- `1 ≤ N ≤ 10000`

---

## Sample Input
3
10
5
10000

## Sample Output
3
2
100

---

## Explanation

- √10 ≈ 3.16 → rounded down → `3`
- √5 ≈ 2.23 → rounded down → `2`
- √10000 = `100`
